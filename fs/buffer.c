/*
 *  'buffer.c' implements the buffer-cache functions. Race-conditions have
 * been avoided by NEVER letting a interrupt change a buffer (except for the
 * data, of course), but instead letting the caller do it. NOTE! As interrupts
 * can wake up a caller, some cli-sti sequences are needed to check for
 * sleep-on-calls. These should be extremely quick, though (I hope).
 */

/*
 * NOTE! There is one discordant note here: checking floppies for
 * disk change. This is where it fits best, I think, as it should
 * invalidate changed floppy-disk-caches.
